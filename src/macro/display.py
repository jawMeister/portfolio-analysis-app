    Interest rates: Higher interest rates can reduce the attractiveness of stocks, as bonds and other interest-bearing assets become more appealing. Lower interest rates can boost stock prices as companies benefit from lower borrowing costs.

    Inflation: Higher inflation can erode purchasing power and negatively impact the real returns of a portfolio. Some assets, like certain commodities or inflation-protected securities, may perform better under higher inflation.

    Liquidity: During times of low liquidity, it can be harder to buy or sell assets without impacting the market price. This can affect the ability to efficiently manage a portfolio.

    GDP Growth: Higher GDP growth can indicate a strong economy and be positive for stocks, while lower GDP growth or a recession can be negative.

    Unemployment rate: High unemployment can be a sign of a weak economy and could negatively impact stocks, while low unemployment could indicate a strong economy and be positive for stocks.

    Political Stability: Political instability can increase market volatility and affect portfolio returns.

    Geopolitical events: Wars, trade disputes, and other geopolitical events can cause market volatility and affect portfolio returns.

    Regulatory changes: Changes in regulations can affect specific sectors positively or negatively.
    
    Deciding which factors to explore depends on the nature of your portfolio and your investment horizon. For a long-term equity portfolio, interest rates, inflation, and GDP growth could be more critical. For a short-term or bond portfolio, interest rates and liquidity might be more important.

    The relevance of each factor also depends on the specific holdings in your portfolio. For instance, if your portfolio consists largely of technology companies, interest rates and GDP growth might have a significant impact due to these companies' reliance on economic growth and cheap financing. Conversely, if you hold many commodity companies, inflation and geopolitical events might be more relevant.

    In your case, let's say we prioritize interest rates, inflation, and liquidity as the most critical factors to explore.
